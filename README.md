# Amber
Take the misery out of looking up your timetable!
## What is Amber?
Amber is a utility written in Python that communicates with a timetable REST API, composing the contents into a friendly message. This bypasses the need to go to a site or other middlemen that could be slow or, frankly, poorly implemented.

Amber was made for a specific college's infrastructure.\
The current implementation of Amber doesn't communicate with Telegram and is instead a TUI utility.
## How to run
Simply run `amber.py` and select the appropriate option.
