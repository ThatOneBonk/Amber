# Amber
Take the misery out of looking up your timetable!
## What is Amber?
Amber is a Telegram bot written in Python+Django that communicates with a timetable REST API, composing the contents into a Telegram message. This bypasses the need to go to a site or other middlemen that could be slow or, frankly, poorly implemented.

Amber was made for a specific college's infrastructure.\
The example JSON is included in this repository.\
